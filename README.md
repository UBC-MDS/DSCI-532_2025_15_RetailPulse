## **About the Project**
Retail managers often struggle to extract meaningful insights from large sales datasets. Traditional tools like **Excel** require excessive manual effort, making real-time decision-making difficult. RetailPulse solves this problem by offering:
- **Dynamic sales trend analysis** with **line charts**
- **Customer retention insights** with **repeat customer tracking**
- **Geographic sales distribution** with **interactive maps**
- **Product performance tracking** with **bar charts** and **word clouds**

The dashboard is built using **Python, Dash, and Plotly**, ensuring an **intuitive, visually rich interface** that enables managers to **optimize inventory, target marketing strategies, and identify revenue opportunities**.
